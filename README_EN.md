## 🔀 Tauri Storage Modes (v0.3.2)

- `tauri-desktop` and `tauri-mobile` now default to **Local mode** on first launch.
- If Supabase is configured, users see a one-time non-blocking prompt: keep local mode or connect cloud sync.
- Users can switch between **Local mode** and **Cloud mode** at any time in settings.
- Mode switching only changes the data source; there is no automatic import/export/merge.
- Virtual pet data remains device-local in both modes and is not synced cross-device.

## 🎯 Core Concept

Momentum is based on the Chained Time-Delay Protocol (CTDP) theory proposed by Edmond on Zhihu, which uses a mathematical model to solve self-control problems:

$$I = \int_{0}^{\infty} V(\tau) \cdot W(\tau) d\tau$$

Where:

- `V(τ)` is the future value function
- `W(τ)` is the weight discount function

## 🔬 The Three Core Principles

### 1. Sacred Seat Principle

By designating a specific trigger action (e.g., "put on noise-canceling headphones," "sit down at the study desk"), you create a "sacred seat." Once this action is triggered, you must complete the focus task in your best possible state. Each time you successfully complete the task, the chain record grows (#1 → #2 → #3...), forming a powerful psychological constraint.

### 2. Principle of Precedent

When faced with a potential rule violation, you have only two choices:

- **Rule as Failure**: The chain is reset to zero and you start over from #1.
- **Rule as Permitted**: The behavior is permanently added to the exception rules and must be allowed in all future instances.

This "case law" mechanism prevents the broken windows effect, allowing the rule boundaries to converge to their most rational state.

### 3. Linear Time-Delay Principle

This principle overcomes the difficulty of getting started by using a "pre-commitment chain":

- Set a pre-commitment signal (e.g., "snap your fingers").
- After giving the signal, you must start the main task within a specified time.
- This utilizes a time delay to lower the initial resistance to starting the task.

## 📖 User Guide

### Create Your First Chain

1. Click "Create Your First Chain" or "New Chain."
2. Set a name for the chain (e.g., "Learn Python").
3. Choose a "Sacred Seat" trigger action (e.g., "Put on noise-canceling headphones").
4. Set the task duration.
5. Configure the pre-commitment chain settings:
   - Pre-commitment signal (e.g., "Snap fingers").
   - Pre-commitment duration (e.g., 15 minutes).
   - Pre-commitment completion condition (usually the same as the main chain's trigger).

### Using the Pre-commitment Feature

1. Click "Pre-commit" on the task card.
2. Perform the pre-commitment signal (e.g., snap your fingers).
3. Fulfill the pre-commitment condition within the specified time.
4. You will automatically enter focus mode.

### Starting a Task Directly

1. Click "Start Task."
2. Perform the "Sacred Seat" trigger action.
3. Enter the full-screen focus mode.

4. Stay focused for the set duration.

### Handling Interruptions

When you need to interrupt a task:

1. Click "Interrupt/Rule Adjudication."
2. Describe the specific behavior.
3. Choose how to handle it:
   - **Rule as Failure**: Resets the chain to zero.
   - **Rule as Permitted**: Adds the behavior to the exception rules.

## 📦 Task Groups

Task Groups allow you to combine multiple related tasks and execute them in sequence.

### Creating a Task Group

1. Click "New Task Group"
2. Set the group name and description
3. Configure time limits (optional)
4. Set repeat counts
5. Add child task units

### Task Group Features

- **Cyclic Execution**: Child tasks execute in order, automatically moving to the next upon completion
- **Time Limits**: Set a total time limit for the entire group
- **Repeat Control**: Each child task can have its own repeat count
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time display of current progress and remaining tasks

## 🏛️ RSIP System

The Recursive Steady-state Iteration Protocol (RSIP) is a personal rule management system that helps you establish and maintain various life rules.

### Core Concepts

- **Policy Nodes**: Represent a life rule or habit
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Rules can have parent-child relationships, forming a rule tree
- **Daily Limits**: By default, only one new rule can be added per day to prevent over-commitment
- **Violation Rollback**: When a rule is violated, the node and all its children are deleted

### How to Use

1. Enter the RSIP view
2. Create root or child nodes
3. Set the rule title and description
4. Optionally configure a timer
5. Follow the rules daily to establish a stable life order

4. 🐤 Teen (Lv.50-74)
5. 🐔 Adult (Lv.75-99)
