# Group View Enhancements

## Summary

Implemented enhancements for the Task Group view to improve parity with single chain views and add requested features.

## Changes

### 1. Individual Task Timers

- **Refactoring**: Extracted task rendering logic from `GroupView` into a new `UnitCard` component.
- **Feature**: Each `UnitCard` now maintains its own `timeRemaining` state and countdown timer.
- **Benefit**: Users can see the countdown for scheduled tasks directly within the group view, just like in the single chain view.

### 2. Auxiliary Streak Display

- **Feature**: Added display of "Appointment Counts" (Auxiliary Streak) to the task card.
- **UI**: Added a calendar-check icon with the count `#{unit.auxiliaryStreak || 0}`.

### 3. Click-to-View Details

- **Feature**: Clicking on a task card (outside of buttons) now triggers the detail view for that specific chain.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `onViewDetail` prop to `GroupView` and `UnitCard`.
  - Connected `App.tsx`'s `handleViewChainDetail` to `GroupView`.
  - Added `onClick` handler to the main card container in `UnitCard`.

## Technical Details

- **File**: `src/components/GroupView.tsx`
  - Created `UnitCard` component.
  - Removed unused `renderUnit` function.
  - Updated `GroupView` to render `UnitCard` components.
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
  - Passed `onViewDetail={handleViewChainDetail}` to `GroupView`.

## Verification

- **Linting**: All TypeScript errors and unused variable warnings have been resolved.
- **Integration**: `App.tsx` correctly passes the required props.
